#### Assertions

    isTrue(test,message)
    
    isFalse(test,message)
    
    equals(expected,actual,message)

    contentsEqual(expected,actual,message)

The property or element values of two objects must match. If they are objects, they should have the same properties & the values of each
should match. If arrays, they must have the same elements (order insensitive).

If strings are passed to contentsEqual, they are assumed to be comma-separated lists.



This is a reference for how it's supposed to work. It may not actually do this at this stage of development.
